Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Possible algorithm solution, but I don't know how beautifully it could work... perhaps I can construct a query
that can do the algorithm in the query (find a whole route to a target location)?

The algorithm requires a starting node, and node N, with a distance between the starting node and N.
Dijkstra's algorithm starts with infinite distances and tries to improve them step by step:

Create a set of all unvisited nodes: the unvisited set.

Assign to every node a distance from start value: for the starting node,
    it is zero, and for all other nodes, it is infinity, since initially no path
    is known to these nodes. During execution, the distance of a node N is the length
    of the shortest path discovered so far between the starting node and N.[18]

From the unvisited set, select the current node to be the one with the smallest
    (finite) distance; initially, this is the starting node (distance zero). If the unvisited
    set is empty, or contains only nodes with infinite distance (which are unreachable),
    then the algorithm terminates by skipping to step 6. If the only concern is the path to
    a target node, the algorithm terminates once the current node is the target node. Otherwise,
    the algorithm continues.

    Technically the "once the current node is the target node" can be an issue since we are unsure if they are looking for street or house or whatnot

    Query could be made regarding if there is a street or whatnot at the target coordinates.. but later!

For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and
    update their distances through the current node; compare the newly calculated distance
    to the one currently assigned to the neighbor and assign the smaller one to it. For example,
    if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with its neighbor
    B has length 2, then the distance to B through A is 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a
    distance greater than 8, then update it to 8 (the path to B through A is shorter). Otherwise,
    keep its current distance (the path to B through A is not the shortest).

After considering all the current node's unvisited neighbors, the current node is removed from
    the unvisited set. Thus, a visited node is never rechecked, which is correct because the distance
    recorded on the current node is minimal (as ensured in step 3), and thus final. Repeat from step 3.

Once the loop exits (steps 3â€“5), every visited node contains its shortest distance from the starting node.
